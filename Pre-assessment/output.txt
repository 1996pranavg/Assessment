What will be the outcome of this IAM Policy?
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [{
"Action": "ec2:*",
"Resource": "*",
"Effect": "Allow"
},
{
"Action": "*",
"Resource": "*",
"Effect": "Deny"
}
]
}

It will allow access for all EC2 and it's related services, and deny for rest of all the services.
