Steps to create public and private subnets in VPC:

Step 1: Create an Elastic IP Address for Your NAT Gateway
A NAT gateway requires an Elastic IP address in your public subnet, but the VPC wizard does not create one for you. Create the Elastic IP address before running the VPC wizard.

To create an Elastic IP address

Open the Amazon VPC console.

In the left navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs.

Choose Allocate new address, Allocate, Close.

Note the Allocation ID for your newly created Elastic IP address; you enter this later in the VPC wizard.

Step 2: Run the VPC Wizard

To run the VPC wizard

In the left navigation pane, choose VPC Dashboard.

Choose Launch VPC Wizard, VPC with Public and Private Subnets, Select.

For VPC name, give your VPC a unique name.

For Elastic IP Allocation ID, choose the ID of the Elastic IP address that you created earlier.

Choose Create VPC.

When the wizard is finished, choose OK. Note the Availability Zone in which your VPC subnets were created. Your additional subnets should be created in a different Availability Zone.

Non-default subnets, such as those created by the VPC wizard, are not auto-assigned public IPv4 addresses. Instances launched in the public subnet must be assigned a public IPv4 address to communicate with the Amazon ECS service endpoint.
To modify your public subnet's IPv4 addressing behavior

In the left navigation pane, choose Subnets.

Select the public subnet for your VPC By default, the name created by the VPC wizard is Public subnet.

Choose Actions, Modify auto-assign IP settings.

Select the Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address check box, and then choose Save.
