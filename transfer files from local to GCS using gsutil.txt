Create a bucket
Buckets are the basic containers that hold your data in Cloud Storage.

To create a bucket:

Open a terminal window.
Use the gsutil mb command and a unique name to create a bucket:
gsutil mb -l us-east1 gs://my-awesome-bucket/
To upload it on GCP from your local hardware:
gsutil cp *.txt gs://my-awesome-bucket
